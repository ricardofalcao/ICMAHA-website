  The conference will take place at Santiago campus, University of Aveiro. 


  [Santiago campus](https://www.ua.pt/file/57161) occupies a vast area situated
  between the lagoon area and the city centre that is equivalent to about 92
  football fields. It is commonly known as a “city within the city” because that
  is exactly what it is – all the teaching and research infrastructures, central
  services and other supporting, cultural, sporting and leisure services are
  concentrated in one single place.

  Aveiro is one of the most beautiful regions in the country and it has
  everything to please (almost) everyone. It has beaches, mountains, rivers, an
  ocean and a lagoon that connects everything and everyone. The lagoon hugs the
  coastline for 45 km and is the result of nature's moods, whose strong winds
  and currents have transformed the coast, moulding the way that the rivers meet
  the Atlantic.
